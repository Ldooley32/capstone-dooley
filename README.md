Create virtual environment
`python -m venv venv`
`venv\Scripts\activate`

commit and push updates to GitHub
`git add .`
`git commit -m "comment"`
`git push origin master`

### support project goals
1. Establish baseline antibiotic usage tends
    a. antibiotic consumption rate
        * prescriptions issued per year
        * antibiotic given to live stock per year 

2. Total number of bacteria resistence per year

3. bacteria resistenc per state and drug usage per state,

4. predict which states will have the most bacteria resisitenc and drug usage. 

5. Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR)
    * SAAR > 1: Indicates higher-than-expected (potential overuse) antibiotic usage.
    * SAAR < 1: Indicates lower-than-expected (potential underuse) antibiotic usage.
    * SAAR = 1: Indicates antibiotic use aligns with expectations.
    show the SAAR in each state with option for years.
